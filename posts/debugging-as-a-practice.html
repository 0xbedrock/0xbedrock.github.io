          Debugging is the part of software development that nobody teaches
          formally and everybody does constantly. Most of what I know about it
          I learned the hard way, staring at a screen at a time I'd rather have
          been doing something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time I've come to think of debugging less as problem-solving and
          more as a practice — something with principles you can improve at
          deliberately.
        </p>
        <h2>State a hypothesis before you change anything</h2>
        <p>
          The worst debugging sessions I've had started with random changes:
          add a log here, comment something out there, restart the server. This
          is not debugging, it is flailing. A hypothesis — even a wrong one —
          forces you to think about the system rather than poke at it.
        </p>
        <h2>Reproduce it first</h2>
        <p>
          If you can't reproduce the bug reliably, you can't know when you've
          fixed it. Before touching any code, make the bug happen on demand.
          This step often reveals the cause before you've written a single line.
        </p>
        <h2>The bug is probably in your code</h2>
        <p>
          Not in the framework. Not in the database driver. Not in the
          operating system. It's almost always in your code, and starting from
          that assumption is faster than the alternative.
