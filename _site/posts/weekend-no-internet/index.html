    <p>My router died on a Friday evening. The replacement arrived Monday morning. In between, I had a laptop, a pile of local files, and no way out.</p>

<p>What followed was the most focused stretch of work I’d had in months.</p>

<h2 id="boredom-as-a-feature">Boredom as a feature</h2>

<p>Without tabs to open on impulse, I stayed in the editor. Problems that I’d been context-switching away from had nowhere to go except toward a solution. It turns out a lot of my “I need to look that up” moments are really “I don’t want to think about this right now” moments.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-actually-needed-offline">What I actually needed offline</h2>

<p>A local copy of the docs I use most often. Man pages. The project’s own test suite as a source of examples. That covered ninety percent of what I reached for. The other ten percent waited until Monday and turned out not to matter much anyway.</p>

<h2 id="the-takeaway">The takeaway</h2>

<p>I now start every focused work session with Wi-Fi off. I don’t always keep it off for long, but the act of turning it off signals something to my brain that closing browser tabs does not.</p>
