title: "The case for boring technology"

Every year there is a new database, a new framework, a new way of deploying software that promises to solve problems you may or may not have. The temptation to adopt it is real and mostly wrong.

Boring technology is not a failure of imagination. It is an acknowledgment that software running in production is not a hobby project, and that the cost of novelty shows up later.

## Boring means understood

When something breaks at 2am, you want a system you understand completely. Boring technology has Stack Overflow answers. It has runbooks. It has colleagues who've seen the error before. Novel technology has a GitHub issue from eight months ago with no reply.

## Novelty has a real cost

Every new tool you adopt is a tool your team has to learn, your hiring pipeline has to screen for, and your future self has to maintain. That cost is often invisible at adoption time and very visible two years later.

## When new technology is worth it

When the boring option genuinely cannot do the job. Not "cannot do it as elegantly" or "requires more configuration" — cannot do it at all. That bar is higher than it sounds, and hitting it is rarer than the hype cycle suggests.
