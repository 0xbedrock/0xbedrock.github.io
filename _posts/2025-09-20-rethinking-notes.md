title: "Rethinking how I take notes"

For most of my career I took notes the way I was taught to in school: comprehensive, organised, filed away. I rarely looked at them again. The act of writing felt productive. The notes themselves were not.

I've spent the last year experimenting with a different approach, and I think I finally understand what went wrong.

## Notes are not storage

I was using notes as an external memory — a place to put things so I didn't have to hold them in my head. The problem is that a note you never re-read provides exactly the same value as a note you never took. Storage without retrieval is just filing.

## Write less, revisit more

The shift that actually helped was taking fewer notes and reading them more often. One short note I return to weekly is worth more than ten thorough ones I never see again. The bottleneck is not capture, it is integration.

## What I do now

A single file per week. Whatever felt worth keeping. Sunday evening I read it, pull out anything still relevant, and archive the rest. The system has no categories, no tags, no hierarchy. It has one question: does this still matter?
