        <p>
          I spent the last few months writing a small compiler as a side project.
          Not because I needed one, but because compilers are one of those things
          I kept saying I'd understand properly someday. Someday arrived.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are rough notes on what I built, what surprised me, and what I'd
          do differently the second time around.
        </p>
        <h2>Start with the simplest possible grammar</h2>
        <p>
          I wasted two weeks trying to design the "right" language upfront. The
          grammar that actually worked was the one I arrived at after cutting
          everything I thought was essential. Arithmetic expressions and
          variables. That's it. Add features only when the infrastructure earns
          them.
        </p>
        <h2>The parser is not the hard part</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone warns you about parsing. Parsing is fine. Recursive descent
          is straightforward enough to write in a weekend. The hard part is the
          middle — taking a tree and deciding what it means. Semantic analysis
          and type checking ate more time than everything else combined.
        </p>
        <h2>Write tests before you write code</h2>
        <p>
          A compiler with no tests is a compiler you can't refactor. I learned
          this the expensive way at the code generation stage. Write a test for
          every construct before you implement it, and run them after every
          change.
