        <p>
          For most of my career I took notes the way I was taught to in school:
          comprehensive, organised, filed away. I rarely looked at them again.
          The act of writing felt productive. The notes themselves were not.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've spent the last year experimenting with a different approach, and
          I think I finally understand what went wrong.
        </p>
        <h2>Notes are not storage</h2>
        <p>
          I was using notes as an external memory — a place to put things so I
          didn't have to hold them in my head. The problem is that a note you
          never re-read provides exactly the same value as a note you never took.
          Storage without retrieval is just filing.
        </p>
        <h2>Write less, revisit more</h2>
        <p>
          The shift that actually helped was taking fewer notes and reading them
          more often. One short note I return to weekly is worth more than ten
          thorough ones I never see again. The bottleneck is not capture, it is
          integration.
        </p>
        <h2>What I do now</h2>
        <p>
          A single file per week. Whatever felt worth keeping. Sunday evening I
          read it, pull out anything still relevant, and archive the rest. The
          system has no categories, no tags, no hierarchy. It has one question:
          does this still matter?
