    <p>Every few years I try a new note-taking app, a new task manager, a new way of organizing my thoughts. And every time, I end up back at the same place: a folder of plain text files.</p>

<p>There is something quietly powerful about a format that requires no special reader, survives every operating system upgrade, and can be searched with a single grep command. I’ve lost data to proprietary formats twice. I haven’t lost a text file yet.</p>

<h2 id="the-switching-cost-is-zero">The switching cost is zero</h2>

<p>Because plain text is universal, I can open it in anything. I’ve used Vim, VS Code, iA Writer, and even cat. The content never changes. The tool is irrelevant.</p>

<p>That decoupling — content from tool — turns out to be the most important property a format can have. It means the file outlasts whichever app I happen to be excited about this month.</p>

<h2 id="what-ive-stopped-missing">What I’ve stopped missing</h2>

<p>Rich text, inline images, fancy kanban views. None of them survived contact with reality. What survived was the habit of writing things down at all, and plain text is the lowest-friction way I’ve found to do that.</p>
