My router died on a Friday evening. The replacement arrived Monday morning. In between, I had a laptop, a pile of local files, and no way out.

What followed was the most focused stretch of work I'd had in months.

## Boredom as a feature

Without tabs to open on impulse, I stayed in the editor. Problems that I'd been context-switching away from had nowhere to go except toward a solution. It turns out a lot of my "I need to look that up" moments are really "I don't want to think about this right now" moments.

## What I actually needed offline

A local copy of the docs I use most often. Man pages. The project's own test suite as a source of examples. That covered ninety percent of what I reached for. The other ten percent waited until Monday and turned out not to matter much anyway.

## The takeaway

I now start every focused work session with Wi-Fi off. I don't always keep it off for long, but the act of turning it off signals something to my brain that closing browser tabs does not.
